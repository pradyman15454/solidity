# Project Title

MyToken - Simple Token Contract

## Description

The MyToken project is a simple token contract implemented in Solidity. It allows users to mint and burn tokens. The contract keeps track of token balances for each address and maintains the total supply of tokens. The token has a name "pulsar" and an abbreviation "PUL". This project serves as a basic example of a token contract and can be used as a starting point for building more complex token systems on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installing
To download the MyToken program, you can either clone the repository from GitHub or download the Solidity source code file directly. 

### Executing program

To run the MyToken program, follow these steps:

1. Open the Solidity development environment of your choice (e.g., Remix IDE, Visual Studio Code with Solidity extension).

2. Create a new Solidity file and name it MyToken.sol.

3. Copy the contents of the downloaded MyToken.sol file into the new Solidity file.

4. Compile the Solidity code to ensure there are no syntax errors.

5. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum testnet or mainnet of your choice.

6. Interact with the deployed contract by calling the mint and burn functions, passing the appropriate parameters.
